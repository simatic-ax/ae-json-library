# JSON Application Example

## Description
This application example demonstrates the usage of the [JSON Library](https://github.com/simatic-ax/json)

This application example consists of two parts.

1. Showing the usage of the library in a PLC Program, which can be downloaded to a 1500 PLC
1. Many examples as UnitTest in the `test` folder

## Execute the Application Example on the PLC (AX Code local)

1. Open a command line interface (CLI) and switch to the target folder like:
      ```sh
      D:
      cd \Examples
      ```
1. Install the application example `AX Code`

      Run the following commands in a CLI
      ```sh
      apax create @simatic-ax/ae-json-library --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com ae-json-library
      axcode ae-json-library
      ```

1. Start a PLCSIM Advanced Instance or using a 1500 PLC. Download a TIA Portal created HWCN with a 1500 standard PLC (Default IP Address 192.168.0.1).

1. If not open, open a terminal in AX Code (`CTRL+SHIFT+รถ`)

1. Start the application example 
   
   ```cli
   apax start [1500]
   ```
   > `1500` is required, if you use a real 1500 PLC instead of PLCSIM Advanced.

      Result:

      After the Download you'll see following conten in the terminal. Exit by pressing `x`.
