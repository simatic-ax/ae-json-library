This application example consists of two parts.

1. Showing the usage of the library in a PLC Program, which can be downloaded to a 1500 PLC
1. Many examples as UnitTest in the `test` folder

## Execute the Application Example on the PLC (AX Code local)

1. Open a command line interface (CLI) and switch to the target folder like:
      ```sh
      D:
      cd \Examples

      ```

1. Start a PLCSIM Advanced Instance. Download a TIA Portal created HWCN with a 1500 standard PLC (IP: Address 192.168.0.1).

1. If not open, open a terminal in AX Code (`CTRL+SHIFT+รถ`)

1. Install dependencies
   
   ```cli
   apax install -L
   ```
1. Build in download the project to the PLC
   
   ```cli
