# JSON Application Example

## Description
This application example demonstrates the usage of the [JSON Library](https://github.com/simatic-ax/json)

This application example consists of two parts.

1. Showing the usage of the library in a PLC Program, which can be downloaded to a 1500 PLC or PLCSIM Advanced
1. Many examples as UnitTest in the `test` folder

## Install the application example and open it locally

1. Open a command line interface (CLI) and switch to the target folder like:
      ```sh
      D:
      cd \Examples
      ```
1. Install the application example `AX Code`

      Run the following commands in a CLI
      ```sh
      apax create @simatic-ax/ae-json-library --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com ae-json-library
      axcode ae-json-library
      ```

### Description of the PLC program
   
   The PLC program executes different steps:

   1. CreateDocument1 
      Add an JSON element of type Integer with value `1234` in a empty JSON document `doc`
   
   1. SerializeDocument1

      doc.Serialize(doc.buffer) serializes the JSON document `doc` into the array of char (doc.buffer).

      Expected result in the array of char: `{"myInt": 1234}`
   
      In this step, the time for serializing will be measured and stored in the variable `TimeCreationDocument1`. The result od serializing will be stored in the string variable `SerializedDocument1`

   1. ParseDocument1
   
      Parse the JSON document `doc` for the `key = myInt` and get the value `1234`
      
   1. ResetJSonDocument1

      Delete all JSON elements in the JSON document `doc`. So it's possible to create a new JSON document with other JSON elements.
   
   1. CreateDocument2

      Create a JSON document with nested JSON elements. Structure of nested JSON document:
      
      ```
      doc 
       |
       +- myBoolean(value = true)
       |
       +- myObject -+- myInt(value = 1234)
                    | 
                    +- myDint(value = 12345678)
      ```

   
   1. SerializeDocument2
   
      doc.Serialize(doc.buffer) serializes the JSON document `doc` into the array of char (doc.buffer).

      Expected result in the array of char: `{"myBoolean": true, "myObject": {"myInt": 1234, "myDint": 12345678}}`

      In this step, the time for serializing will be measured and stored in the variable `TimeCreationDocument2`. The result od serializing will be stored in the string variable `SerializedDocument2`


   1. ParseDocument2

      Parse the JSON document `doc` for the `key = myDint` and get the value `12345678`
   
   1. ResetJSonDocument2

      Delete all JSON elements in the JSON document `doc`. So it's possible to create a new JSON document with other JSON elements.

## Start the application example

1. Start a PLCSIM Advanced Instance or using a 1500 PLC. Download a TIA Portal created HWCN with a 1500 standard PLC (Default IP Address 192.168.0.1).

      > The default ip address can be changed in the apax.yml
      > ```yml
      > IP_ADDRESS: "192.168.0.1"
      > ```
      

1. If not open, open a terminal in AX Code (`CTRL+SHIFT+รถ`)

1. Start the application example 
   
   ```cli
   apax start [1500]
   ```
   > `1500` is required, if you use a real 1500 PLC instead of PLCSIM Advanced.

      Result:

      After the Download you'll see following conten in the terminal. Exit by pressing `x`.

   1. Open the file `default.mon`
   1. Enable monitoring
   1. Observe the values
